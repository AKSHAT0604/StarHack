4. Complete a community event
5. Check points have been added
6. View leaderboard to see updated weekly points

## Notes

- Community events are filtered to show only upcoming/ongoing events
- Users only see events from communities they've joined
- Events can't be completed multiple times
- Completing community events adds to both total points and weekly points
- Event timers update in real-time (refresh page to see updated countdown)
- The "TESTING" reset button doesn't reset community quest completions (they're separate tables)
