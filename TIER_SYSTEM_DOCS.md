A special feature that **protects your streak** if you miss a day of completing daily quests.

### How It Works

4. **Consumption**: Streak Freeze is used up and must be purchased again

### Benefits
- **Tier Protection**: Maintain your hard-earned tier
- **Discount Retention**: Keep your tier discount benefits
- **Peace of Mind**: Travel, sick days, or busy schedules won't reset progress
- **Motivation**: Encourages long-term engagement

### Strategic Use
- **Before Travel**: Buy before going on vacation
- **Busy Periods**: Protect streak during exams/work deadlines
- **Insurance**: Safety net for unexpected situations
