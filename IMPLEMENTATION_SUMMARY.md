# Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document outlines all the changes made to implement the streak system, quest reset timing, and leaderboard improvements.

## Backend Changes

### 1. Database Schema Updates (`database.sql`)

#### Added Columns to `users` table

- **`spent_points`**: Tracks total points spent by the user on rewards
- **`last_daily_completion`**: Tracks when the user last completed all daily quests (used for streak increment)

#### Modified `user_quests` table

- Removed UNIQUE constraint on `(user_id, quest_id)` to allow quest resets
- Added `reset_at` column for tracking when quests can be attempted again

#### Updated Seed Data

- Added current user (user_id = 1, username = 'CurrentUser')
- Added 9 other users with random `points` and `spent_points` values
- Added 6 quests: 3 daily, 2 weekly, 1 monthly

### 2. Backend API Updates (`crud.py`)

#### Updated Models

- **User Model**: Added `spent_points` and `last_daily_completion` fields
- **New LeaderboardUser Model**: Includes `total_points` (points + spent_points)

#### Quest Completion Logic

```python
@app.post("/quests/complete/{user_id}/{quest_id}")
```

- Checks if quest is already completed based on quest type:
  - **Daily**: Can only be completed once per day (resets at midnight)
  - **Weekly**: Can only be completed once per week (resets every Monday)
  - **Monthly**: Can only be completed once per month (resets on the 1st)
  
- **Streak Increment**: When all daily quests are completed:
  - Counts total daily quests and completed daily quests
  - If all daily quests are done and `last_daily_completion` != today:
    - Increments streak by 1
    - Sets `last_daily_completion` to today
  - Returns `all_daily_complete` and `streak_incremented` flags

#### Leaderboard

```python
@app.get("/leaderboard")
```

- Returns users sorted by `total_points` (current points + spent points)
- Shows top 10 users

#### Reward Claiming

```python
@app.post("/rewards/claim/{user_id}/{reward_id}")
```

- Deducts points from user's current points
- Adds the cost to `spent_points`
- Records the reward claim in `user_rewards` table

## Frontend Changes

### 1. PointsContext Updates (`PointsContext.tsx`)

#### State Management

- Removed mock data
- Integrated with backend API
- Added `showCongratulations` state for popup

#### Key Functions

- **`fetchData()`**: Fetches user, quests, rewards, and leaderboard from backend
- **`completeQuest()`**:
  - Calls backend API to complete quest
  - Shows congratulations popup if all daily quests are complete
  - Re-fetches all data to sync UI
  
- **`claimReward()`**:
  - Calls backend API to claim reward
  - Updates user points and leaderboard

### 2. Quests Page Updates (`Quests.tsx`, `Quests.css`)

#### Features

- Added congratulations popup that appears when all daily quests are completed
- Popup shows:
  - ðŸŽ‰ Congratulations message
  - Notification that streak increased
  - "Awesome!" button to close

#### Styling

- Beautiful gradient popup with animations
- FadeIn and slideIn animations
- Overlay background

### 3. Leaderboards Page Updates (`Leaderboards.tsx`, `Leaderboards.css`)

#### Features

- Displays leaderboard based on `total_points` (current + spent)
- Shows rank, username, total points, and streak
- Highlights current user with special styling
- Shows user stats card with:
  - Current rank
  - Total points (with breakdown of current + spent)
  - Streak count

#### Styling

- Clean, modern design
- Top 3 ranks have special badges (gold, silver, bronze)
- Current user row is highlighted in blue

### 4. Rewards Page Updates (`Rewards.tsx`, `Rewards.css`)

#### Features

- Displays all available rewards
- Shows user's current points
- Claim button disabled if not enough points
- Loading state while claiming
- Success/error alerts

#### Styling

- Beautiful gradient cards
- Hover animations
- Disabled state for insufficient points

## Key Features Implemented

### âœ… Streak System

- Streak increments by 1 when ALL daily quests are completed
- Only increments once per day (tracked by `last_daily_completion`)
- Congratulations popup appears with celebration message

### âœ… Quest Reset Timing

- **Daily Quests**: Reset at midnight, available again the next day
- **Weekly Quests**: Reset every Monday (start of week)
- **Monthly Quests**: Reset on the 1st of each month
- Quests won't reappear on page reload - controlled by backend

### âœ… Points Tracking

- **Current Points**: Points available to spend
- **Spent Points**: Total points spent on rewards
- **Total Points**: Sum of current + spent (used for leaderboard ranking)

### âœ… Leaderboard

- Ranked by `total_points` (current + spent)
- Shows all users sorted by their lifetime achievement
- Highlights current user

### âœ… Real-time Updates

- All data fetched from backend
- UI syncs after every action (quest completion, reward claim)
- No stale data from localStorage

## Testing the Implementation

1. **Start the backend**:

   ```bash
   cd "d:\sem 5\StarHack"
   docker-compose up --build -d
   ```

2. **Start the frontend**:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. **Test Quest Completion**:
   - Go to Quests page
   - Complete all 3 daily quests
   - See the congratulations popup
   - Check that streak increased in header

4. **Test Quest Reset**:
   - Complete a quest
   - Reload the page
   - Quest should still show as completed
   - Wait until next day (or change system date) to see it reset

5. **Test Leaderboard**:
   - Complete quests to earn points
   - Claim rewards to spend points
   - Check leaderboard - your total should be current + spent
   - Your rank should update based on total points

6. **Test Rewards**:
   - Go to Rewards page
   - Try claiming a reward
   - Check that points are deducted
   - Check leaderboard - total_points should remain the same

## Database Connection

- The current user is user_id = 1
- Username: 'CurrentUser'
- Email: '<current@example.com>'
- Other users have random points for realistic leaderboard testing

## Notes

- The backend runs on `http://localhost:8000`
- The frontend connects to backend via `API_URL` constant
- PostgreSQL database is managed via Docker
- All timestamps are timezone-aware (TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE)
