# üéØ Your Journey Page - Complete Implementation

## Overview
A comprehensive analytics and progress tracking page showing the user's 2-year fitness journey with interactive charts, health metrics, and achievements timeline. This data is structured to be easily consumable by an LLM for personalized quest generation.

---

## üé® Fixed Issues

### Text Color in Community Events
- **Problem**: White text on white background in community events section
- **Solution**: 
  - Increased text opacity to 95%
  - Added text shadows for better contrast
  - Enhanced all text elements with proper shadowing

```css
.community-quests-header p {
  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.9);
  text-shadow: 1px 1px 2px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}

.quest-description {
  color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.95);
  text-shadow: 1px 1px 3px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);
}
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### New Tables for Journey Tracking

#### 1. **user_community_points_history**
Tracks points earned per community over time (for pie chart)

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_community_points_history (
    history_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(user_id),
    community_id INTEGER REFERENCES communities(community_id),
    points_earned INTEGER NOT NULL,
    quest_completed VARCHAR(200),
    earned_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);
```

**Purpose**: 
- Shows which communities user is most active in
- LLM can use this to recommend similar community events
- Pie chart visualization of points distribution

#### 2. **user_points_history**
Overall points timeline (for line chart)

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_points_history (
    history_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(user_id),
    total_points INTEGER NOT NULL,
    points_change INTEGER NOT NULL,
    activity_description VARCHAR(200),
    recorded_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE
);
```

**Purpose**:
- Tracks growth trajectory
- Shows engagement patterns (active months vs inactive)
- LLM can identify trends and motivational patterns

#### 3. **user_health_metrics**
Comprehensive health tracking (for AI insights)

```sql
CREATE TABLE user_health_metrics (
    metric_id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(user_id),
    metric_date DATE NOT NULL,
    weight_kg DECIMAL(5,2),

    mood_score INTEGER CHECK (mood_score BETWEEN 1 AND 10),
    stress_level INTEGER CHECK (stress_level BETWEEN 1 AND 10),
    energy_level INTEGER CHECK (energy_level BETWEEN 1 AND 10),
    notes TEXT,
    UNIQUE(user_id, metric_date)
);
```

**Purpose**: 
- **Weight**: Track weight loss/gain progress
- **Sleep**: Correlate sleep quality with performance
- **Hydration**: Monitor water intake habits
- **Steps**: Activity level tracking
- **Mood/Stress/Energy**: Mental health indicators
- **LLM Usage**: Generate personalized quests based on improvement areas

#### 4. **user_achievements**

## ü§ñ LLM Integration Strategy

### Data Structure for AI Quest Generation

When ready to integrate LLM, query these tables:

```python
# Pseudo-code for LLM context building
user_context = {
    "profile": get_user_preferences(user_id),
    "history": {
        "favorite_communities": get_top_communities(user_id, limit=3),
        "recent_health_trends": get_health_metrics(user_id, days=30),
        "achievement_velocity": calculate_achievement_rate(user_id),
        "engagement_pattern": analyze_activity_times(user_id)
    },
    "goals": {
        "weight_goal": calculate_weight_trajectory(user_id),
        "fitness_level": estimate_fitness_level(user_id),
        "preferred_activities": get_favorite_activities(user_id)
    }
}

# Send to LLM
prompt = f"""
Generate 3 personalized fitness quests for a user with:
- Favorite activities: {user_context['profile']['favorite_activities']}
- Recent weight progress: {user_context['history']['recent_health_trends']['weight']}
- Available time: {user_context['profile']['available_time_slots']}
- Fitness goals: {user_context['profile']['fitness_goals']}
- Current communities: {user_context['history']['favorite_communities']}

Quests should be:
- Difficulty: {user_context['profile']['preferred_difficulty']}
- Aligned with health conditions: {user_context['profile']['health_conditions']}
- Scheduled for: {user_context['profile']['available_time_slots']}
"""
```

### LLM Quest Generation Workflow

1. **Fetch User Context**: Query all journey tables
2. **Build Prompt**: Structure data for LLM
3. **Generate Quests**: Send to LLM API (GPT-4, Claude, etc.)
4. **Parse Response**: Extract quest details
5. **Insert to DB**: Add personalized quests to `quests` table
6. **Notify User**: "New personalized quests available!"

### Example Personalized Quest

Based on dummy data, LLM might generate:

```
Quest Name: "Morning Yoga Weight Loss Challenge"
Description: "You've made great progress losing 7kg! Let's maintain momentum with 3 morning yoga sessions this week."
Type: weekly
Points: 300
Reasoning: 
- User loves yoga (favorite_activities)
- Available in mornings (time_slots)
- Weight loss goal (fitness_goals)
- Part of Yoga & Mindfulness community
```

WHERE user_id = 1
GROUP BY DATE_TRUNC('month', metric_date)
ORDER BY month;
```

### LLM Context Builder Query
```sql
SELECT 
    u.username,
    up.favorite_activities,
    up.fitness_goals,
    up.preferred_difficulty,
    array_agg(DISTINCT c.community_name) as communities,
    (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM user_quests WHERE user_id = u.user_id) as total_quests,
    (SELECT AVG(weight_kg) FROM user_health_metrics WHERE user_id = u.user_id AND metric_date >= CURRENT_DATE - 30) as recent_avg_weight,
    (SELECT AVG(sleep_hours) FROM user_health_metrics WHERE user_id = u.user_id AND metric_date >= CURRENT_DATE - 30) as recent_avg_sleep
FROM users u
LEFT JOIN user_preferences up ON u.user_id = up.user_id
LEFT JOIN user_communities uc ON u.user_id = uc.user_id
LEFT JOIN communities c ON uc.community_id = c.community_id
WHERE u.user_id = 1
GROUP BY u.user_id, u.username, up.favorite_activities, up.fitness_goals, up.preferred_difficulty;
```
